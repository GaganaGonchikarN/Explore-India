				<!--dummy description---->
				The purpose of our Travel Website - Explore India, is to automate the existing manual system by the help of computerized equipments and full-fledged computer software, fulfilling their requirements, so that their valuable data/information can be stored for a longer period with easy accessing and manipulation of the same. The required software and hardware are easily available and easy to work with.

In the present system, a customer has to approach various agencies to find details of places and to book tickets. This often requires a lot of time and effort. A customer may not get the desired information from these offices and often the customer may be misguided. It is tedious for a customer to plan a particular journey and have it executed properly.

The proposed system is a web based application and maintains a centralized repository of all related information. The system allows one to easily access the relevant information and make necessary travel arrangements. Users can decide about places they want to visit and make bookings online for travel and accomodation. Travel Website, as described above, can lead to error free, secure, reliable and fast management system. It can assist the user to concentrate on their other activities rather to concentrate on the record keeping. Thus, it will help organization in better utilization of resources. The organization can maintain computerized records without redundant entries. That means that one need not be distracted by information that is not relevant, while being able to reach the information.
